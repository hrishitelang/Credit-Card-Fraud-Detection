# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

In this project, I modelled past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. The aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications. To achieve this, I performed data preprocessing, performed exploratory data analysis and calculated the accuracy of the algorithms using anomaly detection models such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF) and Isolation Tree Classifier. Accuracy observed in both LOF and Isolation Tree Classifier are 99.65% and 99.77% respectively. It was achieved using the dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project is also being assessed using several other classification methods.
